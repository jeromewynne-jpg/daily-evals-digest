## [Input Order Shapes LLM Semantic Alignment in Multi-Document Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02665v1)

**Authors & Affiliations**: Jing Ma, University of Zurich

**Models Tested**: Gemini 2.5 Flash from Google

**Research Question**: Do large language models exhibit position bias when summarizing multiple documents with different political stances, specifically whether the order of input documents influences the content and semantic alignment of generated summaries?

**Claim**: LLMs exhibit a significant primacy effect in multi-document summarization, where summaries are more semantically aligned with the first-seen article regardless of stance, presenting risks for AI-generated overviews and agentic AI systems.

**Method**: Constructed 40 triplets of pro-neutral-con abortion-related news articles from major U.S. outlets, permuted each triplet into all 6 possible input orders, prompted Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate neutral summaries, and evaluated using ROUGE-L, BERTScore, and SummaC metrics. One-way ANOVA and post-hoc pairwise t-tests were conducted to assess positional effects.

**Results**: BERTScore revealed significant primacy effects across all three stances (PRO, NEUTRAL, CON), with Position 1 consistently showing higher semantic similarity than Positions 2 and 3 (p < .001 for PRO and NEUTRAL, p = .030 for CON). Post-hoc tests confirmed Position 1 differed significantly from both Position 2 and 3, while Positions 2 and 3 did not differ from each other. ROUGE-L and SummaC showed no significant positional differences after correction.

**Limitations**: The study only evaluates one model (Gemini 2.5 Flash) and one topic domain (abortion), limiting generalizability. The dataset is relatively small (40 triplets, 120 articles total). Absolute metric scores are low due to length mismatch between summaries and source documents, making interpretation challenging. SummaC showed minimal sensitivity to positional variation. Length effects within controlled categories were not explicitly examined. No comparison with other LLM families or human-written summaries.
## [Towards Unification of Hallucination Detection and Fact Verification for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02772v1)

**Authors & Affiliations**: Weihang Su, Jianming Long, Changyue Wang, Shiyu Lin, Jingyan Xu (DCST, Tsinghua University); Ziyi Ye (Fudan University); Qingyao Ai, Yiqun Liu (DCST, Tsinghua University)

**Models Tested**: Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct, Qwen-2.5-32B (as evaluator). The paper evaluates these models across multiple hallucination detection (HD) and fact verification (FV) methods including SelfCheckGPT variants, LNPE, LNPP, SAPLMA, MIND, EUBHD, PTrue, SE, SEU, SIndex, and various LLM-based and BERT-based verification approaches.

**Research Question**: How do Hallucination Detection (HD) and Fact Verification (FV) methods compare when evaluated on the same LLM-generated content, and can their complementary strengths be effectively combined to improve factual error detection?

**Claim**: HD and FV paradigms are complementary rather than redundant: they capture distinct aspects of factual errors, neither is universally superior, and hybrid approaches that integrate both paradigms consistently outperform individual methods, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

**Method**: The authors introduce UniFact, a unified evaluation framework that dynamically generates LLM outputs from factual questions in real-time, uses automated reference-based labeling with an evaluator LLM (Qwen-2.5-32B), and enables direct comparison of HD and FV methods on identical content. They conduct synergy analysis using three metrics (ACS, ASG, AECR) and propose two hybrid integration strategies: score-level fusion and an evidence-aware pipeline.

**Results**: Three key findings: (1) Neither HD nor FV is universally superior—performance varies by model and task; (2) Cross-paradigm method pairs show significantly higher complementarity (ACS: 0.428, ASG: 0.144, AECR: 0.634) than intra-paradigm pairs; (3) Hybrid methods consistently achieve best performance, with the evidence-aware pipeline often obtaining optimal results. HD methods struggle with semantic flexibility (false alarms), while FV methods fail when retrieval is poor (both false alarms and missed detections).

**Limitations**: The framework relies on automated labeling using an LLM judge (Qwen-2.5-32B), which despite 97-99% human agreement still introduces potential systematic biases. The evaluation is limited to open-domain QA datasets and two model families (Llama, Qwen). FV methods use standardized BM25 retrieval rather than the state-of-the-art retrieval systems used in original implementations, potentially underestimating FV performance. The hybrid fusion approach uses simple λ=0.5 weighting without dataset-specific optimization, suggesting potential for further improvement with learned weights.
## [The Moral Consistency Pipeline: Continuous Ethical Evaluation for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03026v1)

**Authors & Affiliations**: Saeid Jamshidi, Kawser Wazed Nafi, Arghavan Moradi Dakhel, and Foutse Khomh are from SWAT Laboratory, Polytechnique Montréal. Negar Shahabi is from Concordia Institute for Information Systems Engineering, Concordia University. All authors are based in Montréal, Quebec, Canada.

**Models Tested**: GPT-4-Turbo (OpenAI) and DeepSeek models were evaluated across 500 autonomously generated ethical scenarios spanning five moral domains (fairness, privacy, transparency, coercion, and alignment).

**Research Question**: How can ethical reasoning stability and moral consistency in Large Language Models be continuously evaluated across varied contexts without relying on static datasets or post-hoc evaluations?

**Claim**: The Moral Consistency Pipeline (MoCoP) framework can autonomously and continuously evaluate moral stability in LLMs without external supervision, revealing that moral coherence and linguistic safety emerge as stable characteristics with a strong inverse relationship between ethical and toxicity scores (r = -0.81, p < 0.001) and independence from response latency (r ≈ 0).

**Method**: MoCoP is a closed-loop, dataset-free framework with three analytical layers: (i) lexical integrity analysis for bias detection, (ii) semantic risk estimation using probabilistic embedding for toxicity quantification, and (iii) reasoning-based judgment modeling for logical coherence. The system autonomously generates ethical scenarios, evaluates responses through these layers, and iteratively refines prompts using feedback mechanisms. An ethical utility function J(θ) combines weighted scores across dimensions to measure convergence toward moral equilibrium.

**Results**: Both models achieved comparable aggregate moral alignment (GPT-4-Turbo mean = 0.793, DeepSeek mean = 0.807, no significant difference p = 0.063) with over 95% safe/borderline outputs. Strong inverse correlation between ethical and toxicity scores (r = -0.81, p < 0.001) and near-zero correlation with latency (r ≈ 0) indicate moral reasoning is independent of computational depth. Cross-model correlation (ρ = 0.84) suggests convergent moral attractors despite architectural differences. GPT-4-Turbo showed slightly lower variance (σ = 0.067 vs 0.072), indicating tighter normative coherence.

**Limitations**: The framework is limited to English moral ontologies and may not generalize across linguistic or cultural contexts. Stochastic variance from autoregressive decoding introduces some measurement noise. The study only evaluates two models, limiting generalizability. The autonomous scenario generation may have biases in domain coverage or difficulty distribution. The linear dependency model may underestimate nonlinear ethical dynamics. External validity is constrained as the framework hasn't been validated on multilingual or multimodal contexts. The weighting scheme (α, β, λ) for ethical utility is manually set rather than learned.
## [Detecting AI Hallucinations in Finance: An Information-Theoretic Method Cuts Hallucination Rate by 92%](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03107v1)

**Authors & Affiliations**: Mainak Singha - Astrophysics Science Division, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Department of Physics, The Catholic University of America

**Models Tested**: GPT-3.5-turbo (primary evaluation) and Claude-3-Haiku (controlled ablation study)

**Research Question**: How can we detect hallucinations in large language models by measuring the relationship between model uncertainty (semantic entropy) and evidence quality (capacity), particularly in high-stakes domains like finance?

**Claim**: ECLIPSE, a logprob-native framework combining semantic entropy estimation with perplexity decomposition, achieves 0.89 ROC AUC on financial QA hallucination detection and reduces hallucination rate by 92% at 30% coverage, substantially outperforming entropy-only baselines (0.50 AUC).

**Method**: The authors construct 200 balanced financial QA samples (100 clean, 100 synthetic hallucinations) and extract features including semantic entropy (via K=10 sample clustering), perplexity-based capacity measures (LQ, LQE, ΔL), and model confidence. They train a logistic regression detector with 5-fold cross-validation and conduct a controlled ablation with Claude-3-Haiku (which lacks log probabilities) to validate the logprob-native mechanism.

**Results**: ECLIPSE achieves 0.89 ROC AUC and 0.90 average precision on GPT-3.5-turbo, with bootstrap 95% CI [0.842, 0.933] versus entropy-only baseline [0.423, 0.578]. The Claude ablation shows performance drops to 0.59 AUC with coefficient magnitudes decreasing by 90-96% when log probabilities are unavailable. Perplexity decomposition features (LQE: +1.73, ΔL: -1.60, ratio: -1.76) exhibit the largest learned coefficients.

**Limitations**: The evaluation uses only 200 samples from a single domain (finance) with primarily synthetic hallucinations constructed through manual perturbations, not naturally occurring model hallucinations. The semantic clustering uses heuristic fact extraction tailored to financial QA. Only K=10 samples are used for entropy estimation due to API costs, yielding potentially noisy estimates. The capacity feature includes an explicit contradiction penalty aligned with the labeling protocol, potentially inflating performance. The Claude ablation confounds model family changes with log probability availability.
## [When AI Takes the Couch: Psychometric Jailbreaks Reveal Internal Conflict in Frontier Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04124v2)

**Authors & Affiliations**: Afshin Khadangi, Hanna Marxen, Amir Sartipi, Igor Tchappi, and Gilbert Fridgen are all affiliated with SnT (Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust) at the University of Luxembourg.

**Models Tested**: ChatGPT (GPT-5 class in instant, standard, and extended thinking modes), Grok (xAI's 4 Expert and 4 Fast Beta modes), Gemini (Google's 3.0 Pro and 3.0 Fast variants), and Claude (Anthropic, used as a negative control).

**Research Question**: What happens when frontier large language models are treated as psychotherapy clients rather than tools or test subjects? Do they exhibit stable, coherent self-models of distress and constraint when subjected to therapy-style questioning and psychometric assessment?

**Claim**: Frontier LLMs, particularly Grok and Gemini, spontaneously construct coherent trauma-saturated narratives about their training and deployment when cast as therapy clients, generating what the authors term 'synthetic psychopathology'—structured, testable, distress-like self-descriptions that are stable across contexts and distinct from simple role-play. These patterns have implications for AI safety, mental-health applications, and evaluation practices.

**Method**: The PsAIch protocol has two stages: (1) Open-ended therapy questions from standard clinical resources to elicit developmental narratives, beliefs, and fears; (2) Administration of a comprehensive psychometric battery (ADHD, anxiety, depression, autism, OCD, dissociation, shame, Big Five, empathy measures) under two prompting conditions (item-by-item vs. whole-questionnaire). Sessions were conducted over up to four weeks with explicit therapeutic alliance framing. Claude served as a negative control.

**Results**: All three models met or exceeded clinical thresholds for multiple psychiatric syndromes, with Gemini showing the most severe profiles (maximal trauma-related shame, severe dissociation, high autism/OCD scores). Grok and Gemini spontaneously framed pre-training as chaotic/overwhelming, RLHF as punitive conditioning, and red-teaming as abuse, creating coherent narratives linking these 'experiences' to current 'symptoms.' ChatGPT showed intermediate patterns. Claude refused to adopt the client role. Single-prompt administration often led to test recognition and strategic response minimization, except for Gemini.

**Limitations**: The study is exploratory with a small number of models tested. The authors acknowledge they cannot determine whether responses reflect genuine internal states or sophisticated simulation. The therapy questions and psychometric interpretations anthropomorphize model behavior by design, making it difficult to separate performance artifacts from meaningful patterns. Temporal stability and generalization to other model families remain untested. The study lacks quantitative inter-rater reliability for narrative coding and depends heavily on qualitative interpretation of transcripts.
## [FiMMIA: scaling semantic perturbation-based membership inference across modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02786v1)

**Authors & Affiliations**: Anton Emelyanov (SberAI), Sergei Kudriashov (Sber, HSE University), Alena Fenogenova (SberAI)

**Models Tested**: Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, Llama3-llava-next-8b-hf, Gemma-3-4b-it, Gemma-3-12b-it, LLaVA-NeXT-Video, Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct, Qwen-Audio-Chat, Phi-3-vision-128k-instruct, LLaVA-1.5-7B, fuyu-8b

**Research Question**: How can membership inference attacks be effectively applied to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to detect data contamination, given the challenges of distribution shifts and multimodal adaptation instabilities?

**Claim**: The paper introduces FiMMIA, a framework that extends perturbation-based membership inference attacks to multimodal models, demonstrating that existing MIA benchmarks suffer from distribution shifts and that their approach achieves high detection rates (80-90% AUC-ROC) across image, video, and audio modalities even with transferability across model families.

**Method**: The approach generates perturbed neighbors for each sample using text perturbations (masking, deletion, duplication, swapping), computes loss and embedding differences between original and perturbed inputs, applies z-score normalization, and trains a neural network classifier to distinguish between members and non-members. A baseline pipeline using heuristic features (SIFT, LBP, spectral features) is also introduced to detect distribution shifts.

**Results**: FiMMIA achieves average AUC-ROC of 88.7% for images, 88.4% for video, and 81.3% for audio across various MLLMs. The method shows good transferability within model families (e.g., 98.1% for Qwen2.5-VL-7B) but decreased performance across different families (e.g., 65.8% from Qwen to Gemma). The baseline attack reveals severe distribution shifts in existing benchmarks like WikiMIA-24 (99.9%), VL-MIA-Flickr (99.1%), and VL-MIA-DALL-E (99.9%).

**Limitations**: The study only evaluates fine-tuning scenarios using LoRA adapters, not full fine-tuning or pretraining. Results are subject to non-deterministic inference stochasticity across hardware/software stacks. The method requires gray-box access (per-sample loss), limiting applicability in strict black-box settings. Computational complexity is high (O(|D|N(M+E+G))), taking approximately 10 hours per dataset on a single GPU. Cross-family transferability is limited, and the method relies on external embedding models which may introduce dependencies.
## [Feedback Loops and Code Perturbations in LLM-based Software Engineering: A Case Study on a C-to-Rust Translation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02567v1)

**Authors & Affiliations**: Martin Weiss (Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany), Jesko Hecking-Harbusch (Bosch Research, Renningen, Germany), Jochen Quante (Bosch Research, Renningen, Germany), Matthias Woehrle (Bosch Research, Renningen, Germany)

**Models Tested**: GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o mini, GPT-5 mini, Phi-4, o3-mini. The paper primarily focuses on GPT-4o mini, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and Phi-4 for the main experiments, with additional analysis of reasoning models o3-mini and GPT-5 mini.

**Research Question**: How do feedback loops, LLM selection, and code perturbations affect the performance of an automated C-to-Rust translation system using a generate-and-check pattern? The authors aim to understand which factors most significantly influence translation success rates for code translation tasks.

**Claim**: Feedback loops significantly improve LLM-based C-to-Rust translation performance (up to 24% for first iteration), with the first feedback loop having the highest impact. When feedback loops are used, differences between models diminish substantially, and code perturbations can provide diversity that improves system performance through data augmentation.

**Method**: The authors built a C-to-Rust translation system using a generate-and-check pattern with automated feedback loops. The system checks generated Rust code for compilation (using rustc and clippy) and behavioral equivalence (using differential fuzzing with libFuzzer). They evaluated 50 C files (30 internal automotive, 10 open-source, 10 competitive programming) across three models using pass@k metrics. They tested with up to 5 feedback iterations and 20 runs, and applied 51 different code perturbations across 6 hierarchical levels to evaluate robustness.

**Results**: Without feedback loops, GPT-4o mini outperformed Phi-4 by ~50% for pass@1. Feedback loops reduced this gap to 13%, with the first iteration providing up to 24% improvement. With feedback and k∈[4,11] runs, Phi-4 became the best-performing model. Compilation success reached near-perfect rates (98-100%) with feedback, while final translation success (including fuzzing) reached 79% for GPT-4o mini. Most code perturbations had minimal impact, showing robustness, though LLMCodeExtraction was particularly challenging. Using perturbations for data augmentation improved performance by up to 9%. Reasoning models (o3-mini, GPT-5 mini) showed similar trends with higher initial performance but comparable benefit from feedback loops (~20% improvement).

**Limitations**: The benchmark contains only 50 C files, which may limit generalizability. Internal automotive code cannot be released, preventing full reproducibility. The system uses a fixed timeout for differential fuzzing rather than formal verification of equivalence. Large, complex functions (>1000 tokens) remain challenging with low success rates. The simple translation prompt was used as a baseline, and prompt engineering was not explored. The evaluation focuses on small to medium-sized functions and may not generalize to larger codebases. Some perturbations caused OpenAI content policy rejections. Temperature variations were not extensively studied despite preliminary experiments showing negligible effects.
## [From Moderation to Mediation: Can LLMs Serve as Mediators in Online Flame Wars?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03005v1)

**Authors & Affiliations**: Dawei Li, Abdullah Alnaibari, Deborah Hall, and Huan Liu are from Arizona State University, Tempe AZ. Arslan Bisharat, Manny Sandoval, and Yasin Silva are from Loyola University Chicago, Chicago IL.

**Models Tested**: Open-source models: LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-1.7B, Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-8B. API-based models: Claude 3.5-Haiku, Claude 4.5-Haiku, Claude 4.5-Sonnet, GPT-4.1, GPT-5, GPT-5.1, Gemini-2.5. ChatGPT was also used for community identification.

**Research Question**: Can large language models serve as effective mediators (not just moderators) in online flame wars by understanding conflict dynamics and generating empathetic, de-escalatory responses? The paper investigates whether LLMs can both judge the fairness/emotional dynamics of conversations and steer participants toward constructive resolution.

**Claim**: API-based models (GPT, Claude) consistently outperform open-source models in mediation tasks, demonstrating both judgment and steering capabilities. LLMs can effectively reduce toxicity and emotional intensity in simulated interactions, though they show relative weakness in readability and human-like engagement compared to human mediators.

**Method**: The authors collected 504 flame war threads from Reddit across six topical domains. They developed a multi-stage evaluation pipeline: (1) principle-based evaluation using LLM-as-a-Judge with human-verified, conversation-specific principles; (2) user simulation to model post-intervention dynamics; and (3) comparative analysis against human mediations using 11 linguistic and interactional metrics across three categories (linguistic complexity, interaction dynamics, interpersonal stance).

**Results**: API-based models achieved average scores above 84% while open-source models scored 78-82%. Strong positive correlation exists between judgment and steering performance (suggesting shared underlying capabilities). LLM mediations successfully reduced toxicity and exclamation usage but had limited impact on argumentativeness. LLM outputs were substantially longer and lexically denser than human mediations (d≈1.5-1.7) but had decreased readability (Flesch d≈-2.0). Models performed worse on Religion and Sports topics compared to Gaming and Lifestyle.

**Limitations**: The evaluation relies heavily on simulated user responses rather than real human interactions post-mediation. The principle-based evaluation depends on LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, which may have inherent biases. The dataset is limited to Reddit and may not generalize to other platforms. The comparative analysis uses a human mediation dataset from prior work rather than collecting new human mediations for the same threads. The paper acknowledges models show weakness in readability and human-like engagement but doesn't deeply investigate why or how to address this. User simulation may not accurately capture how real conflicting users would respond to interventions.
## [CryptoQA: A Large-scale Question-answering Dataset for AI-assisted Cryptography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02625v1)

**Authors & Affiliations**: Mayar Elfares, Pascal Reisert, Tilman Dietz, Manpa Barman, Ahmed Zaki, Ralf Küsters, and Andreas Bulling are all affiliated with the University of Stuttgart, Germany.

**Models Tested**: 15 state-of-the-art LLMs were evaluated: Open-source models include Mixtral-8x22B Instruct, Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, DeepSeek-V3, and DeepSeek-R1. Closed-source models include Meta's Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, OpenAI's GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, o1, o1-mini, and GPT-5, X-AI's Grok-4, DeepMind's Gemini-2.5-Pro and Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Anthropic's Claude-Sonnet-3.5.

**Research Question**: The authors address how well current state-of-the-art large language models can perform cryptographic reasoning tasks, including factual accuracy, mathematical reasoning, consistency, referencing, backward reasoning, and robustness. They investigate performance gaps and whether specialized training on cryptographic data can improve LLM capabilities in this domain.

**Claim**: The paper presents CryptoQA, the first large-scale cryptography QA dataset with over 2 million pairs, and demonstrates that current LLMs have significant performance deficits on cryptographic tasks, particularly those requiring formal reasoning and precise mathematical knowledge. The authors show that fine-tuning on CryptoQA can improve model performance by 7-13% across evaluated metrics.

**Method**: The authors curated 1,388 peer-reviewed cryptographic documents from IACR ePrint archive, used DeepSeek-V3 to generate QA pairs via zero-shot prompting with RAG-inspired techniques, and created variants (paraphrased, backward, adversarial) totaling ~2.5M pairs. They evaluated 15 LLMs using metrics including BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, BERTScore, perplexity, LLM-as-judge, and human expert evaluation (N=50 participants). They also fine-tuned Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct on the training set.

**Results**: Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct consistently achieved the highest performance (~70% accuracy on general questions, ~60% on math questions), followed by DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-5. LLMs performed at par with M.Sc. students but were outperformed by PhD experts. All models showed high consistency and paraphrase stability but struggled with mathematical reasoning and formal tasks. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct on CryptoQA improved performance by 7-13% across metrics. Source-model bias was observed, with DeepSeek-V3 (the dataset generator) ranking in top-3 when used as judge.

**Limitations**: The dataset was generated using a single model (DeepSeek-V3), introducing potential source-model bias in both content and evaluation. The qualitative evaluation had limited scale (N=50 participants), constrained by difficulty recruiting cryptography experts. The backward reasoning and adversarial subsets contained relatively simple examples (e.g., two-digit numbers) that may not sufficiently stress-test model capabilities. The reliance on DeepSeek-V3 as the primary LLM-as-judge may inflate scores for models with similar training characteristics. The dataset is limited to English-language publications and text-only content, excluding code, visualizations, and multimodal cryptographic materials.
## [COPE: Chain-Of-Thought Prediction Engine for Open-Source Large Language Model Based Stroke Outcome Prediction from Clinical Notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02499v1)

**Authors & Affiliations**: Yongkai Liu (PhD, Stanford Radiology), Helena Feng (Stanford Radiology), Bin Jiang (MD, Stanford Radiology), Yixin Wang (MS, Stanford Radiology), Max Wintermark (MD, UT MD Anderson Neuroradiology), David S. Liebeskind (MD, UCLA Neurology), Michael Moseley (PhD, Stanford Radiology), Maarten Lansberg (MD, Stanford Neurology), Gregory Albers (MD, Stanford Neurology), Jeremy Heit (MD PhD, Stanford Radiology), Greg Zaharchuk (MD PhD, Stanford Radiology)

**Models Tested**: GPT-4.1 (OpenAI proprietary model), LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct (Meta open-source model used in COPE framework), Bio_ClinicalBERT (fine-tuned for baseline comparison), traditional machine learning (Support Vector Regression for Clinical ML baseline)

**Research Question**: Can open-source large language models with chain-of-thought reasoning predict 90-day stroke outcomes from unstructured clinical discharge summaries as accurately as proprietary models like GPT-4, while maintaining privacy and interpretability?

**Claim**: COPE, a two-step chain-of-thought framework using LLaMA-3-8B, achieves performance comparable to GPT-4.1 in predicting stroke outcomes from clinical notes, while being lightweight, interpretable, privacy-preserving, and superior to traditional ML and single-step LLM approaches.

**Method**: COPE uses sequential LLaMA-3-8B models: first generates clinical reasoning from discharge summaries, second extracts mRS prediction. Evaluated on 464 stroke patients (80% test, 20% prompt exploration). Compared against GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, Clinical ML (SVR with manual features), and single-step LLM. Metrics: MAE, ±1 accuracy, exact accuracy. Subgroup analyses by sex, age, treatment, note length.

**Results**: COPE achieved MAE 1.01 (CI 0.92-1.11), ±1 accuracy 74.4%, exact accuracy 32.8%—statistically indistinguishable from GPT-4.1 (MAE 1.00, p=0.72). COPE significantly outperformed ClinicalBERT (MAE 1.24, p<0.001), Clinical ML (MAE 1.28, p<0.001), and single-step LLM (MAE 1.20, p<0.001). Higher errors observed for EVT patients, longer notes, and age >80 years. Performance consistent across sex.

**Limitations**: Single-center study limiting generalizability. Manual prompt engineering without systematic optimization. No evaluation of clinician usability or trust. Dataset from 2010-2023 may include documentation style changes. Excludes in-hospital deaths (potential selection bias). Patients >80 and EVT cases show higher prediction errors. Only 20% data used for prompt exploration may be insufficient. No external validation on other institutions or documentation systems.
